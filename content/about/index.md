#### The Scuttlebutt

![Steven Wroblewski](/img/steven-wroblewski.png)

I head up the analytics department at Jacbobson Rost, a marketing Agency based out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 

Previously, I've held several analytics roles both on the client and agency side. My experience is primarily in the digital analytics space, which spans many facets including technology, media, and web platforms. My passion lies in helping to build and execute successful data strategies for clients and teams. 

Outside of the day job I spend time working on side projects, staying involved in local startup and content creator communities, watching boxing, and trolling around the world.

**Business - UBrew (Co-Founder)**
- Helped launch and operate a homebrewing experience startup, which was born out a Startup Weekend event. Our team of seven crafted an MVP and took honorary mention at the event. Three of us continued the prospect of this by building a brand called UBrew and hosting homebrewing workshops at a local farm-to-table restaurant's test kitchen. We successfully hosted multiple events with the goal of further learning whether this concept could be turned into a profitable business. 
- My focus as co-founder revolved around building the brand creatively, marketing strategy, and hands-on assistance during workshops.
