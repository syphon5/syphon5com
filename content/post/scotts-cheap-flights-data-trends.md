#### Let's Look At Some Trends.

##### Are we receiving more email deals as time goes on?
**With so many flight tracking and deal apps out there, we need to make sure we are getting good bang for our buck.** Scott's Cheap Flights has increased their team size and the user base (aka revenue) significantly over the past year. This should point to more resources, which can provide a higher volume of flights deals. Are we seeing this in the data?

SCF email deals in my inbox have increased every year since 2017. The pace last year was looking underwhelming until the second half, where a surge of deal emails led it to top 2018. SCF is off to a great start in 2020, having the highest cumulative pace through the first near three weeks of the year.
